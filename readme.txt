This is the project using Sample API (https://sampleapis.com/api-list/coffee)

Project contains main file index.html, JavaScript code in main.js, css styling and images in /css and /img respectively.

Launching index.html will open the page with a very simplistic interface. 
2 buttons representing 2 different types of coffee (iced and hot respectivelly)

After clicking one of them fetch method is initiated and data is displayed. 
Unlike Star Wars API, data loads instantly with no delays, so overlay is not required.

Each card contains image, title, ingredients and description of each drink.
